PHP stands for HyperText Preprocessor. PHP scripts are executed in the Server. PHP files have an extension ".php". 
We can install the php file from the official website of php where documentation can be easily accessed. After installing, 
the next of the step is to ensure whether the php is properly installed or not by inputing php --version in the command 
prompt of your respective device. Once, the php is properly installed all it remains is there to execute a php program 
in any of IDEs. One of the most popular IDEs out there is Visual Studio Code where we should create a folder containing 
PHP program. And under the folder create and write your PHP programs and to start or make it work start the server by 
typing php -S localhost:8000 which will initialize the PHP developmental server and once the server gets working, go to 
the web browser you using and type in http://localhost:8000/ and the file name containing the PHP program afterwards.
This way PHP program works in your device. Now we learn more about PHP by doing assignment of the college lecturers.
